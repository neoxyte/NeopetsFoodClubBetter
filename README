NeopetsFoodClubBetter
=====================

A script that automatically places bets on the Neopets Food Club Game. Bets are automatically scraped off of neopets.com/~myfoodclubbets

This is a work in progress. Use at your own risk as this code is FAR
from complete.

TODO:
-Provide better exception handling
-Provide better commenting / docstrings and general documentation
-Handle passwords and password hashing better
-Implement a clean and nice looking GUI


Update:

This program no longer works as the website where bets were gathered from no longer exists. 
Also I am pretty sure that neopets is dead. I am leaving this here for historical reasons!
